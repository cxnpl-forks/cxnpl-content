  Know Your Customer (KYC) and Know Your Business (KYB) are processes for verifying the identity of individuals and organisations in financial transactions. They are critical for maintaining regulatory compliance, protecting financial institutions from illicit activities, and ensuring a secure and trustworthy business environment. KYC involves verifying the identity of individual customers to prevent identity theft, fraud, and money laundering. This includes collecting and validating personal information such as identification documents, addresses, and financial history. KYB extends this process to businesses, ensuring that organisations are legitimate and comply with regulatory requirements. It includes verifying the business's legal status, ownership structure, and financial health, as well as assessing potential risks associated with the business.
